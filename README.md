# Advice Project

This Advice in Havering website is an experimental project, which aims to be mobile friendly, providing easy access to free advice and support information, mainly for the local community. There are also important National telephone and website links.

Although the site is primarily focussed on the extensive public advice services provided by Citizens Advice, other charity organisations within the London Borough of Havering, do offer similar assistance to the public, but none with the same extensive National support infrastructure.
